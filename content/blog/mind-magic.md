Note of caution: As a beginner myself, I feel like I ought to be an expert on what things are "beginner level".
But I'll admit I'm not as much an expert on each of the topics themselves.

Everybody, wizard or otherwise should dabble a little in the arcane and mysterious art that is mind magic.
After all, everyone lives within their own mind.

Below I will describe some techniques that anyone can apply to improve the mind they live in.


# Memory

<!-- A method of loci -->

## Lists

Ever start the day with a mental todo list, walk out the door and forget literally every single item on it?
Ever do a repetitive task that you've done a few times before, but realise you've forgotten the important details?

Lucky for you there's a simple technique to stick a list in your mind with as much or as little detail as you'd like.
And fairly quickly too if you have a good imagination!

### Step 1: A walk down memory lane

I want you to imagine your bedroom.
Not to go look at it, but to imagine it.
If you're already in your bedroom it can help to close your eyes (if you can read this with your eyes closed, I'm impressed).

Now, we're going to walk a **path** through your bedroom looking at four different places of interest.
You don't have to imagine actually walking from place to place, just moving your attention from one to the next is fine.
Although, don't let that stop you if you find that works for you!

Let's start from standing in the doorway.
I like to go anti-clockwise around the room, so for my room I have a framed painting at the first thing on my right, I then have my desk (I know, poor boundaries of space), next I have my bed and finally my bedside table.
There we are, four places of interest that naturally flow from one to the other.
Don't worry if you have to skip over items, but if something really sticks in your mind as it "should" be in a certain place it's fine to go over four.

There's not a hard and fast limit, but a maximum of 10 and an average of 7 seems reasonable for the size of a palace.
Did I mention this is called a "Memory Palace"?
Pretty cool huh?


### Step 2: A list item

Next we're going to organise our list of things to remember
For this example we're going to remember this short list:

1. Butter
2. Sugar
3. Self raising Flour
4. 2 eggs

Yes, it's the ingredients for a cake, what of it?

For each of those items we need to come up with a mental image to represent it.
The can be 2D like a photograph, or a 3 directional object but it should be as vivid and utterly ridiculous as possible.
Ideally it should be silly enough to make you laugh and vivid enough you could touch it, but if it evokes any sort of emotional reaction such as curiosity or anger that's great.
We then imagine that the locations we thought of earlier have the mental image on or attached to them in some way.
It can be simply placed on it, or integrated into it in some way (don't worry I'll give examples).

So for butter, we're placing that in my framed painting.
The painting actually happens to be some modern art made out of blocks and circles, so my first thought to make it ridiculous is to break that in some way.
What if the shapes were all stuck to the background using butter?
I'd imagine they'd keep falling off so I'd have to keep re-sticking them back on so maybe as I first pay attention to it one of the shapes can fall off.
I'll have some butter just casually taped to the wall beside the painting to help me stick them back on.
I can already smell the scent of button on hot toast so let's make the background out of toast too for good measure.

Next we have sugar and my desk.
Let's go for a simpler image this time, and imagine that the desk is almost completely buried under a mountain of sugar.
I can just see the corners of the desk and my monitor poking out of the sides of the mound.
To help cement that it's sugar I can imagine tasting some of the sugar and how it's grains would feel beneath my fingers.

Then we have self raising flour and my bed.
My first thought is a bag of flour getting out of bed without using an alarm, but that's kind of difficult for me to imagine (maybe you'll have better luck).
So let's go with a raze instead of raise and have the sack of flour swipe a match against it's side to light itself on fire.
Oh no! It's accidentally caught the bed on fire too!

And finally we have 2 eggs and my bedside table.
Things with draws are simple to integrate with, just imaging opening the draw and out comes two angry hens!
They're so angry they each pecks you twice (ouch!) before squawking out the room leaving behind two eggs.
Numbers can be tricky to integrate, two eggs can easily become three.
My only advice is to either find some clever way to integrate the number into the image or (as I've just demonstrated) repeat the number a few times.

And there we have it!
I'm not going to say it's no effort, but once you have a place sorted out in your mind it's surprisingly easy to do.
And recall is as simple as walking through the room again.


Downsides:
- Only for lists
- Lists must be ordered
- Re-ordering/removing items is difficult
- Maintenance (although it can be pretty easy)
- Organisation (use another memory palace?)

Some advanced ideas:
- Who said the location had to be real?
- Body parts
- Altering the location to make it more memorable and give list items more "stick"
- Re-usable locations
  - Imagine the list item "fading" away
- Memory palace of memory palaces?


# Feelings

<!-- CBT -->

Whether you think they're messy and get in the way, or are lovely things that keep you connected with the world around you, feelings are a natural part of being human.
They evolved to keep us safe and sound in an uncertain world, which reflects the patterns you find them in


# Equanimity

## Exercises

Meditation


# Quick counting

Group items into lists of 2, 3 or 5 and count those.
