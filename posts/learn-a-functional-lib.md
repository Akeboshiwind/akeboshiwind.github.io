Title: Learning a Functional Library

I really wanted to get the language metaphor to work but I think a tools analogy works much better.

When I was mainly working in OO land...

Here's a simple way to approach any functional library: Start with bigger tools that get the job done, learn about smaller tools as you go.

Problems with this approach:
- Your initial code will be "bad" in that it doesn't use the simplest/smallest tool for the job
- You will feel like an amature (you are one so...)
