There are many skills required to be a good developer:
- Pure programming
- Learning
- Requirement elicitation
- Code/design analysis
- ...

NOTE: This blog will not be about these other skills, but it should be noted that if you want to improve yourself/your career you should **definitely** work on those first.

When talking about pure programming though I see myself as an intermediate.
Recently I've been thinking about how to go beyond this, what actual concrete steps should I take to master this skill?

<!-- end-of-preview -->

Some thoughts I've had:
1. Analyse my own code & processes
   - What do I think are flaws
2. Analyse some well written code
   - Short bits of code
     - [Jason Bullers' AOC day7 post](https://jbullers.github.io/posts/2023-09-22-aoc-2022-day7) was an excellent introduction to the idea "your job is to teach Clojure your domain language by writing predicates, reducing functions, etc. and then leveraging the excellent core library to do the actual work"
   - Real integrations
     - Code I think is good quality
3. Read papers/books?
4. Carefully considered project
   - Take a small/medium sized project and try to implement that as well as possible
5. Pair programming with someone better
   - How can I use this to actually improve?
   - Point out areas on how to design things better?
   - Find out things to read/learn?


## What does "Analysing code" even mean?

How do I actually go about that?

Just reading the code clearly isn't enough.

Should I try and identify patterns?

This should definitely be combined
